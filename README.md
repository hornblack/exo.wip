# exo.wip
what is going on ? dont be afraid 2 dev here. i have another dev github and 3 real githubs.. just dev ! 
(if u want local copies figure out how 2 pull the copies , merge from our JBash cli etc. 



-exo frames
-exo clis 
- the emulated fpga willl first be on 501  .and 501 should be in cli . .able 2 be invisible .
- so u need 2 get cli going . feell free 2 get it plugging into an exo frame. . its just an exo cli ofc. 
-the real ccli and even real frame should be EMUlated or HARD verilog . hopefully our js will melt 2 verilog. 
- and the symbols 4 chips are still the ssame we just melt the js 501 engine 2 v/hdl w/e . 
-exo fpga (can we use real tooling 4 fpga's on emulators? should beable 2 ofc. its all cli shit/signals.

  VISUALLY i think if it "BOOTS UP" with a cli in 1 "Iframe" and a "gui" in another can even network those 2gether. .
  
  u are doing pre boot p , dns stylel stuf from the start and get them 2 ready 2 load jo1rk or x86 or any other emulator
  can even choose at this time or just do regular cli stuff monefessh mining and mini mex here. "do iframs scale like textareas? test it
 can try diff genesis frames
